# 100 Days Of Code 


### Day 00: October 2, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learned how to connect git with [github](github.com) account and push changes to the github repositories. Also, i learned how to initialize, create a repository and add files to it. At the end, how to commit, using some statements to know what changes have been made to it. Let's see what Day 2 holds for me.

### Day 01: October 3, Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Since, it's the beginning of this challenge I solved only two problems today on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives), that is, Problem 2 and 3. I am continuing to do my best and I will succeed.
