# 100 Days Of Code

### Day 1: May 21: Tuesday, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I've started with Project Based Learning of Bootstrap 4 and the first video that I watched was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZnNnvXO8HI&t=330s) and also, I learned that there are only classes that have to be used in basic HTML tags. These classes are already predefined in bootstrap.css file and I'm still in progress of this work will edit this tomorrow once it gets completed.

Learnt how to scale images and use hover for different effects.

### Day 0: May 18, Monday, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I resumed this challenge since we're all in lockdown and I didn't want to waste my time on nothing. I've started learning front-end programming. To be more precise, I'm doing project based learning on HTML, CSS and Javascript.


###*I'm resuming this after a very long time and this time I hope I'll be able to continue this for 100 days.*

###Story so far (during lockdown, 22 April- 18 May) :

1. I've built a page with Nav bar, Hover features and different button customizations.
2. I've built a 'Tap Music' web app using Javascript. Idk if you'll even call that a web app. LOL. But I learnt few things from it.
3. I learn how to make a 'Modal' that drops down information and included a 'X' button for that drop down text modal.

### Day 00: October 2, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learned how to connect git with [github](github.com) account and push changes to the github repositories. Also, i learned how to initialize, create a repository and add files to it. At the end, how to commit, using some statements to know what changes have been made to it. Let's see what Day 2 holds for me.
