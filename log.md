# 100 Days Of Code 


### Day 00: October 2, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learned how to connect git with [github](github.com) account and push changes to the github repositories. Also, i learned how to initialize, create a repository and add files to it. At the end, how to commit, using some statements to know what changes have been made to it. Let's see what Day 2 holds for me.
