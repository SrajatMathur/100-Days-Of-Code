# 100 Days Of Code 

### Day 01: October 3, Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Since, it's the beginning of this challenge I solved only two problems today on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives), that is, Problem 2 and 3. I am continuing to do my best and I will succeed.

### Day 00: October 2, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learned how to connect git with [github](github.com) account and push changes to the github repositories. Also, i learned how to initialize, create a repository and add files to it. At the end, how to commit, using some statements to know what changes have been made to it. Let's see what Day 2 holds for me.

###*I'm resuming this after a very long time and this time I hope I'll be able to continue this for 100 days.*

###Story so far (during lockdown, 22 April- 18 May) :

1. I've built a page with Nav bar, Hover features and different button customizations.
2. I've built a 'Tap Music' web app using Javascript. Idk if you'll even call that a web app. LOL. But I learnt few things from it.
3. I learn how to make a 'Modal' that drops down information and included a 'X' button for that drop down text modal.

### Day 0: May 18, Monday, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I resumed this challenge since we're all in lockdown and I didn't want to waste my time on nothing. I've started learning front-end programming. To be more precise, I'm doing project based learning on HTML, CSS and Javascript.
